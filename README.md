## Steps:  
### 1. Create a storage volume
Find instructions [here](https://utrechtuniversity.github.io/vre-docs/docs/getting-started.html)

### 2. Create a simple workspace (Ubuntu 20, 1 CPU core)
Find instructions [here](https://servicedesk.surf.nl/wiki/display/WIKI/Start+a+simple+workspace)
Make sure to add the storage volume that you created in the previous step.

### 3. Install Ansible on your local PC  
You can [install Ansible via pip](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#installing-and-upgrading-ansible)  
or [install Ansible via apt](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-configure-ansible-on-ubuntu-20-04)  

[Further reading about ansible](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/conceptual-articles/an-introduction-to-configuration-management-with-ansible)

### 4. Create an inventory file
In this file you specify the server addresses and if necessary you can group them. In our case we add the IP address of the Research Cloud workspace.

Open the file `/etc/ansible/hosts` with a text editor (e.g. `nano`):

`sudo nano /etc/ansible/hosts`

Add the following contents:
```
[researchcloud]
server1 ansible_host=<IP-address>

[all:vars]
ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3
```

### 4. Test the connection 
Use the following command to test your connection (find your username in the research cloud portal under the profile tab).

`ansible all -m ping -u <researchcloud username>`

You should see this response:
```
server1 | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
```

Now you can use Ansible to run tasks on the Research Cloud workspace.

### 5. Install something on the remote machine

Run an `apt install` task on the workspace using ansible (e.g. install zip).

`ansible server1 -m apt -a "name=zip state=latest" -u <username> --become`

`-m` stands for Ansible module, in this case we use the `apt` module to run apt install remotely.  
`-a` The -a option accepts options either through the `key=value` syntax or a JSON string   
`-u` specify user  
`--become` run the command as root  

Now we know how to run commands remotely via ansible, now let's create a script.
In Ansible this is called a 'playbook'.

### 6. Create a playbook

Create a new directory and an ‘ansible playbook’ called e.g. `test.yml`
Add the following script:
```
---
- name: Some playbook
  hosts: server1
  tasks:
  - name: Print something
    debug:
      msg: "Printing a test message"
```

Run it as follows:
`ansible-playbook test.yml -u <username>`

Now extend the script with some other commands, feel free to experiment 

It is good practice to use [built-in modules](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/index.html) of ansible as much as possible to perform tasks on a server (in our case the research cloud workspace). However, it is also possible to [run shell commands](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/shell_module.html) or run a script.

In this example we use the `pip` built-in module to install asreview:
```
---
- name: Some playbook
  hosts: server1
  tasks:
  - name: Install ASReview LAB through pip
    pip:
      name: asreview
  - name: Print something
    debug:
      msg: "Printing a test message"
``` 
Now extend the script with some other commands, feel free to experiment :smiley:

### 7. Create a script 
Now create your own playbook in a public GitHub repository. The playbook will be called in a Research Cloud plugin.

The playbook should do the following

1. Install git when it is not yet present (you could perform a separate check of the installed packages using [package_facts](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/package_facts_module.html) and then add a conditional task, but there is also a short-cut using the `state` in the [apt module](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/apt_module.html#ansible-collections-ansible-builtin-apt-module))
3. Clone a public GitHub repository. The creator of the workspace that uses this plugin should be able to specify the repository url during the creation of the workspace. Clone the repository to `/data/volume_2`
Hint: it is possible to use 'parameters' in your ansible script. In the next step, you need to define the parameter in the Research cloud component as well so that the user can define the value when he creates a workspace. [More info](https://servicedesk.surf.nl/wiki/display/WIKI/Using+parameters)

### 8. Create a component 
Now [create a component](https://servicedesk.surf.nl/wiki/display/WIKI/Create+a+component) in Research Cloud. Make sure to add the parameter that you used in the ansible script.

### 9. Create a new application
Now [create a new Catalogue Item](https://servicedesk.surf.nl/wiki/display/WIKI/Create+a+catalog+item). You can use an existing application as a template (e.g. use Ubuntu 20.04 sudo enabled), make sure to add `SRC External plugin` first and then simply add your plugin.

### 10. Final step
Now go back to the dashboard and create a new workspace with the application that you just created to see if it is working!

Afterwards, feel free to experiment a bit more, but do delete all the workspaces and storage units when you are done!
